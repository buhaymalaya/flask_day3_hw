FLASK INSTRUCTIONS TEXT - ALWAYS ADD TO VENV PROJECT AS A GUIDE

1. Create virtual environment -- python3 -m venv venv
(second venv is the name so whatever you choose to name the environment)
If there is a popup, click no

2. Activate virtual environment (venv) shell - source venv/bin/activate
type every time you want to activate virtual environment
Venv\scripsts\activate - windows

3. Install flask before importing - pip3 install flask

4. pip3 freeze > requirements.txt (contains all dependencies and packages)
- run to update whenever a change is made within venv

pip3 install python-dotenv

5. to run file, type: flask run (instead of play button)

6. create .env file outside of venv folder

7. remember to use:
pip freeze

.gitignore and enumerate files to not follow

8. .env (to contain private/secret info/API/database)
FLASK_APP = run.py
FLASK_DEBUG = 1

flask run 


COLLABS

Grab repo link to collab on
Clone repo
To download exact same requirements from cloned repo, type: 
pip install -r requirements.txt (after activating venv)
Create your own .env file since that was ignored in original repo
