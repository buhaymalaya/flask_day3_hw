Grouping same endpoints into one class 
ie @app.post(‘/post’) and app.get(‘/post’)

Marshmallow
3rd party library
Used to validate data coming into routes
Serializes data we want to go out as a response to user
ie using passwords; for response to specify in marshmallow schema, pw is expected as receipt but not included in response
Pip install marshmallow

Flask-smorest
Built on top of Marshmallow
Provides robust documentation
Helps implement best practices with minor work
Pip install flask-smorest

Blueprint
Increases modularization and sections of code
From flask-smorest import Blueprint
Tying in routes to bp instead of flask_app
Register bp in app init file

Schemas (via Marshmallow)
Validates data coming in
Serializes data going out
Validating what data we want to go out
Create new file - schemas.py

Configuration
On app init file, from flask_smorest import Api
Instantiate with flask app api = Api(app)
Create new file config.py - create a class Config (to configure flask app)
Configuration for flask-smorest
