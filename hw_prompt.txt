Homework Day 3 - Enhancing REST API with Flask-Smorest and Marshmallow

In this assignment, you will elevate your REST API by integrating Flask-Smorest for resource blueprint 
creation and Marshmallow for schema implementation. The additional challenge involves organizing routes 
into MethodView classes for a cleaner and more structured codebase.

    Implement a blueprint for each resource using Flask-Smorest.
    Ensure that the blueprints are well-organized and clearly separated for each resource.
    Create Marshmallow schemas for each resource.
    Define schema structures that accurately represent the data models for each resource.
    Ensure the schemas can handle data validation for incoming and outgoing requests.
    Utilize the Marshmallow schemas to validate data coming into the API (request validation).
    Implement validation for data going out of the API to ensure consistency (response validation).
    (Optional)

    Refactor your route implementations into Flask MethodView classes .
    Organize the classes in a logical and maintainable structure.
    Ensure each class corresponds to a specific resource and encapsulates related functionality.
